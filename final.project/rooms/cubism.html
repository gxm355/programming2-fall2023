                        <p>Fascinated by the Picasso piece she had previously painted, Kanika decided to try her hand at Cubism to create fascinating and complex imagery. Here a woman holding a mandolin is depicted, and this piece was part of a two piece series by Kanika.</p>

                        <p>The centerpiece between the two other portraits, this painting displays an agitated horse in battle, a note to the grand historical context behind many of Kanika's paintings. The original piece is not by Picasso though, it is by an Indian artist named MF Hussain, a man who many know as the 'modern Cubist.'</p>

                        <p>The sequel to Kanika's painting of 'The Yielded Mandolin,' this portait is meant to depict a man from the early 1910s in England. Kanika particularly enjoyed the creative freedom of Cubism, specifically the ability to leave some interpretation up to the observer.</p>
