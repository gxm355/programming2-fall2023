                        <p>This painting is based off of the work of Jean Singer Sargent, an American artist from the mid 1800s that painted figures from across Europe. Inspired by his work, Kanika decided to emulate one of his portraits, adding her own cultural elements to it.</p>

                        <p>Paul Gauguin is a very notable (yet controversial) painter from the 1840s. His work stretched to many across French Polynesia, something that intrigued Kanika and drove her to recreate one of his portraits.</p>

                        <p>Noticing the fine brushstrokes and use of Indian design in Deepa Vedpathaks work, Kanika wanted to create an impressionist painting to reflect her traditions, and create piece of work that brings a sense of playfulness to the observer.</p>
