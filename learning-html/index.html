	<h1>President Barack Obama</h1>
	
	<p> Barack Obama served as the <i>44th President of the United States</i>. His story is the <b>American story</b> â€” values from the heartland, a middle-class upbringing in a strong family, hard work and education as the means of getting ahead, and the conviction that a life so blessed should be lived in service to others. </p>
