        <p>French toast, also known as "eggy bread," is a classic breakfast dish made by dipping slices of bread into a mixture of beaten eggs, milk, and often flavored with vanilla extract, cinnamon, or nutmeg. The coated bread slices are then cooked on a griddle or skillet until golden brown and slightly crispy on the outside, while remaining soft and fluffy on the inside.<br>
            French toast can be enjoyed in various ways. It can be served as is, with a dusting of powdered sugar or a drizzle of maple syrup. It pairs well with a variety of toppings such as fresh berries, sliced bananas, whipped cream, or even a dollop of yogurt. For a savory twist, some people prefer to top it with bacon, cheese, or herbs.<br>
            This delightful dish is not only delicious but also a fantastic way to use up stale bread as it helps revitalize its texture and flavors. French toast is a versatile option that can be enjoyed for breakfast, brunch, or as a sweet treat any time of the day.<br>
            With its crispy exterior, soft interior, and endless topping possibilities, French toast is a beloved comfort food that adds a touch of warmth and sweetness to any meal.
