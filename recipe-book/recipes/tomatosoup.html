        <h3> How to make homemade tomato soup </h3>
        <div class="next"
        <p><b>Roast the tomatoes:</b> 
        <ol>
        <li>Roasting the tomatoes with aromatics before blending into the soup builds serious flavor. It’s a quick and easy step that means your soup goes from good to great. If you don’t have access to ripe, in-season tomatoes, using whole canned tomatoes are perfectly fine. </li>
        <li>Flavor the soup with ingredients that compliment tomatoes. Balsamic vinegar, basil and garlic are always a good idea where tomatoes are concerned. A pinch of chilli flakes/red pepper flakes will add a hum of heat if you like spicier foods.A little sugar tempers the acidity of the tomatoes but is completely optional.</li>
        <p><b> Make the soup:</b>
        <ol>
            <li> In a large pot or Dutch oven set over medium-high heat, cook the onions, garlic and basil in a little olive oil or butter until soft and translucent. Add the roasted tomatoes and tomato paste to this base along with stock/broth. </li>
            <li>Bring to a boil then cook until all the ingredients are soft then transfer to a blender and blend until smooth (alternatively use an immersion blender). Season to taste with salt and black pepper and add cream. Bring back up to a simmer then serve hot with bread of your choice or grilled cheese sandwiches.</li>
