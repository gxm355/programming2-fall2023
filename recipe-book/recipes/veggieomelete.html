            A veggie omelette is a delicious and healthy dish made by whisking eggs and cooking them with a variety of vegetables. The most common vegetables used in a veggie omelette are bell peppers, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and broccoli, but you can use any vegetables of your choice.<br>
            The omelette is typically made by sautéing the vegetables until they are slightly tender and then adding the whisked eggs on top. The mixture is cooked until the eggs are set and cooked through. The omelette can be folded in half or rolled up, and it is usually served hot.<br>
            A veggie omelette is a versatile dish that can be enjoyed for breakfast, brunch, or even as a light lunch or dinner. It can be served on its own or accompanied by toast, a side salad, or some fresh fruits. The omelette provides a good source of protein from the eggs and essential nutrients from the vegetables.

            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely chopped red onions</li>
            <li>¼ cup finely chopped red peppers</li>
            <li>¼ cup sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 cup fresh baby spinach</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2-3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons shredded cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>Fresh parsley for serving</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in an 8-inch or 10-inch non-stick skillet over medium heat.</li>
            <li> Add the red onions, red peppers and mushrooms and cook until crisp tender, about 3-5 minutes. </li>
            <li>Add the spinach and continue cooking until the spinach wilts, about 1 more minute.</li>
            <li>Transfer the vegetables to a small bowl and wipe down the pan.</li>
            <li>Crack and beat eggs with water in a small bowl. Pour the egg mixture in the same pan. As eggs begin to set around the edge of the skillet, use a spatula to gently push cooked portions toward the center of the skillet. </li>
            <li>Tilt and rotate the skillet to allow uncooked eggs to flow into empty spaces.
                When eggs are almost set, add the cooked vegetables to half of the omelet and add the cheddar cheese on top. 
            </li>
            <li>Place a spatula under the un-filled half, and fold over.
                Gently slide from the skillet onto a plate. Season with salt and pepper and serve immediately top with fresh parsley.
